# INSTALLATION
# 
# I am using Windows 10 with miniconda to manage python environments and
# dependencies and VS Code as my IDE. These last two have some compatibility
# issues (see https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/11638) that
# that can be resolved by switching the default terminal in VS Code from
# powershell to cmd.exe (F1 > Terminal: Select default profile). I then
# install an environment for working with Herbie by copying its YAML file
# (listing dependencies and versions) from the github repository. 
#
# Notes
#
# In step 3, replace {githubURL} with the current URl. As of Nov 2021, this is:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaylockbk/Herbie/master/environment.yml
#
# Before steps 5-7, you may need to add the following directory to your system
# PATH to help windows find conda.exe: C:\Users\{username}\miniconda3\condabin
#
# Installation steps:
#
# 1. install miniconda3 (for Python 3.8+)
# 2. open VS Code to project directory (and set default terminal to cmd)
# 3. open a (cmd) terminal at this directory
# 4. copy the dependencies YAML with "curl -o environment.yml {githubURL}"
# 5. set up paths with "conda init"
# 6. create the environment with "conda env create -f environment.yml"
# 7. (optionally) update with "conda env update -f environment.yml"
#
# The new conda environment is named "herbie" (this name is on the first line
# of the downloaded YAML file). Make sure to select this environment when
# working on the project (in VS Code: F1 > Select Interpreter). This should
# cause VS Code to activate the environment automatically whenever a new
# shell (cmd) is opened, or when sending code to the python interpreter.
#
# Install modules using "conda install ..." in the activated environment
